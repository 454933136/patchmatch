# PatchMatch

This project is a pretty old attempt to implement PatchMatch and is **not** robost and **not** even complete. 

I am writing this because several people have forked this repo. I wanna thank whoever did it but please notice the code is not usable right now.

Currently the project:

 - requires opencv2 to run
 - requires output image has the same width and height with source image (which is unreasonable)
 - doesn't support masked image, which means you can't use it for inpainting right now

Frankly, I feel sorry when I look back at the quality of it. But I'd still like dump it here for (possible) future improvement. If you want to find a good reference for implementing PatchMatch there are lots of good repos on Github, please get out of this repo and explore further. 

Thank you for reading this.
